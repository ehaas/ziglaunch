Welcome to **Zig Launch**. Here you'll find a collection of introductory files to help get you jump started into using the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/).

> Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.

Zig is a simple but very powerful language. Soon, you'll be on your way to making anything from your next little utility, website, compiling and using C code, to even making an operating system.

Head on over to ["Posts"](/posts/) to see the project examples and get started.
